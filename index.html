        <h2>About FADYL</h2>
        <p>
            Desertification is one of the most pressing global challenges of our time. Since 1994, the United Nations has been at the forefront of efforts to combat desertification, a phenomenon that affects millions of people and ecosystems around the world. Historically, regions like the Sahara were lush meadows teeming with vegetation; today, they are vast deserts.

    <section id="threat">
        <h2>The Expanding Threat of Desertification</h2>
        <p>
            Earth’s land is not solely composed of water. Approximately 40% of the planet’s land area, excluding Antarctica, is classified as drylands. Alarmingly, between 2015 and 2019, the world lost at least 100 million hectares of healthy and productive land each year, an area equivalent to twice the size of Greenland. This degradation has profound implications for food security, biodiversity, and the livelihoods of billions of people.

    <!-- Climate Change Section -->
    <section id="climate">
        <h2>The Dual Impact of Climate Change</h2>
        <p>
            Climate change exacerbates desertification. Human activities contribute to over 5 million square kilometers of dryland degradation. Recent studies indicate that 77.6% of Earth's land experienced drier conditions during the three decades leading up to 2020 compared to the previous 30-year period. This persistent aridity threatens agricultural productivity, water resources, and the health of ecosystems.

    <!-- Consequences Section -->
    <section id="consequences">
        <h2>Consequences of Desertification</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Agricultural Decline:</strong> Degraded lands result in reduced crop yields, threatening food security for approximately 1.5 billion people who directly depend on these areas.</li>
            <li><strong>Biodiversity Loss:</strong> The destruction of habitats leads to the decline of numerous plant and animal species, disrupting ecosystems and diminishing biodiversity.</li>
            <li><strong>Economic Impact:</strong> In Africa alone, the economic losses due to aridity between 1990 and 2015 amounted to about 12% of the continent’s GDP, with projections indicating even greater future losses.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>FADYL’s Commitment to Action</h2>
        <p>
            At FADYL (Fight Against Drylands), we are dedicated to combating desertification through proactive measures. Our efforts focus on urban greening initiatives, public awareness campaigns, and collaborative partnerships with organizations such as the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), the Great Green Wall for the Sahara, and Seed Programs International.
        </p>
        <h3>Our Key Actions Include:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Urban Greening Initiatives:</strong> We plant gardens in cities and towns to prevent desert expansion and enhance urban resilience.</li>
            <li><strong>Public Awareness Campaigns:</strong> We educate communities about the causes and effects of desertification, empowering individuals to take action.</li>
            <li><strong>Collaborative Partnerships:</strong> We collaborate with organizations like the UNCCD, the Great Green Wall for the Sahara, and Seed Programs International to implement large-scale restoration projects.</li>
        </ul>
